# Converting Kelvin
With our knowledge of JavaScript, let’s convert Kelvin to Celsius, then to Fahrenheit.
For example, 283 K converts to 10 °C which converts to 50 °F.

## TODO 1: 
- The forecast today is 293 Kelvin.
- To start, create a variable named kelvin, and set it equal to 293.

## TODO 2:
- Celsius is similar to Kelvin — the only difference is that Celsius is 273 degrees less than Kelvin.
- Let’s convert Kelvin to Celsius by subtracting 273 from the kelvin variable. Store the result in another variable, named celsius.

## TODO 3:
- Use this equation to calculate Fahrenheit, then store the answer in a variable named fahrenheit.
- Fahrenheit = Celsius * (9/5) + 32

## TODO 4:
- When you convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit, you often get a decimal number.
- Use the .floor() method from the built-in Math object to round down the Fahrenheit temperature. Save the result to the fahrenheit variable.

## TODO 5:
- Use console.log and string concatenation to log the temperature in fahrenheit to the console as follows:
- "The temperature is ### degrees Fahrenheit."

- HINT: Replace the ### with the value stored in the farenheit variable.
