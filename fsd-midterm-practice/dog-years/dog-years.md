# Dog Years
Dogs mature at a faster rate than human beings. We often say a dog’s age can be calculated in “dog years” to account for their growth compared to a human of the same age. In some ways we could say, time moves quickly for dogs — 8 years in a human’s life equates to 45 years in a dog’s life. How old would you be if you were a dog?

Here’s how you convert your age from “human years” to “dog years”:

The first two years of a dog’s life count as 10.5 dog years each.
Each year following equates to 4 dog years.
Before you start doing the math in your head, let a computer take care of it! With your knowledge of math operators and variables, use JavaScript to convert your human age into dog years.


## TODO 1: 
- Create a variable named myAge, and set it equal to your age as a number.

## TODO 2: 
- Create a variable named earlyYears and save the value 2 to it. Note, the value saved to this variable will change.

## TODO 3: 
- Use the multiplication assignment operator to multiply the value saved to earlyYears by 10.5 and reassign it to earlyYears.

## TODO 4: 
- Since we already accounted for the first two years, take the myAge variable, and subtract 2 from it.
- Set the result equal to a variable called laterYears. We’ll be changing this value later.

## TODO 5:
- Multiply the laterYears variable by 4 to calculate the number of dog years accounted for by your later years.
- Use the multiplication assignment operator to multiply and assign in one step.

## TODO 6:
- If you’d like to check your work at this point, print earlyYears and laterYears to the console.
- Are the values what you expected?

## TODO 7:
- Add earlyYears and laterYears together, and store that in a variable named myAgeInDogYears.

## TODO 8:
- Write your name as a string, and store the result in a variable called myName.

## TODO 9:
- Write a console.log statement that displays your name and age in dog years.
- Use string concatenation to display the value in the following sentence:
- "My name is NAME. I am HUMAN AGE years old in human years which is DOG AGE years old in dog years."
- Replace "NAME" with myName, "HUMAN AGE" with myAge, and "DOG AGE" with myAgeInDogYears in the sentence above.
